# Tools:

### Various tools have been used in this project, in this project:

- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs) was used for discussions related to SEO and routing, as well as using the attractive feature of **server components**
- [Redux Tool Kit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) was used to share information between components
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) was used for styling. In general, for large projects, it is better to use css preprocessors and avoid css in js due to performance and caching issues, but in general, this issue is a trade off and it is better to make the final decision in consultation with the team members.
- To send the request to the server, the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) library was used, which has many features and we can use them
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) was used for development. It is better to use Typescript for projects as much as possible to prevent human errors and bugs that appear as a result of these errors, but if we do not intend to use Typescript in a project, we must use [Js doc](https://jsdoc.app/) for more security.
