# Pages:

## Vendors:

#### In this project, we had a page that showed a list of restaurants in a certain area

#### Naturally, trying to get all the available restaurants in the form of a request cannot be a logical and reasonable thing

#### There are two approaches to handle this issue:

- is using pagination buttons
- using pagination scrolling

#### In this project, we were asked to use the second approach to solve the problem, and we did it using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
